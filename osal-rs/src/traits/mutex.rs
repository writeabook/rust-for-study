//! Mutex trait definitions.
//!
//! This module provides traits for mutual exclusion (mutex) synchronization
//! primitives, enabling safe shared access to data across multiple tasks.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Mutexes prevent race conditions by ensuring only one task can access
//! protected data at a time. This module provides both low-level raw mutex
//! operations and high-level RAII-style interfaces.
//!
//! # Concepts
//!
//! - **RAII Guards**: Locks are automatically released when guard goes out of scope
//! - **Priority Inheritance**: Some implementations support priority inheritance to prevent priority inversion
//! - **ISR Safety**: Special methods for use in interrupt service routines
//!
//! # Deadlock Prevention
//!
//! - Always acquire mutexes in the same order
//! - Don't hold locks longer than necessary
//! - Avoid calling blocking operations while holding a lock
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use osal_rs::os::Mutex;
//!
//! let mutex = Mutex::new(0);
//!
//! // Lock automatically released when guard goes out of scope
//! {
//!     let mut guard = mutex.lock().unwrap();
//!     *guard += 1;
//! } // Lock released here
//! ```

/// Low-level raw mutex operations.
///
/// This trait defines the basic mutex primitives that interface directly
/// with the underlying RTOS mutex implementation.
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// Implementations should support priority inheritance where available to
/// prevent priority inversion problems in real-time systems.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// - `lock()` must only be called from task context (not ISR)
/// - `lock_from_isr()` must only be called from ISR context
/// - `unlock()` must be called by the same task that acquired the lock
/// - Deadlocks can occur if locks are not acquired in consistent order
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use osal_rs::traits::RawMutex;
///
/// // Acquire and release lock
/// if raw_mutex.lock() {
///     // Critical section
///     raw_mutex.unlock();
/// }
/// ```

    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `True` - Lock was successfully acquired
    /// * `False` - Lock acquisition failed (should be rare)
    ///

    ///     // Protected code here
    ///     raw_mutex.unlock();
